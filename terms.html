                <p>
                    Hello and welcome! We are glad that you are taking the time to read these terms of service (the “Terms”).
                </p>
                <p>These Terms are important as they, together with your booking confirmation email (the “Booking Confirmation”), set out the legal terms on which Travel Services are made available to you through our Service. They also cover any interactions or communications you have with us through our Service.
                </p>
                <p>Your use of our Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of these Terms. To book a Travel Service, you must also accept these Terms. If you do not accept these Terms, then please do not use our Service or book a Travel Service.</p>
                <p>We may change these Terms at any time and your future use of our Service following changes to these Terms is subject to you accepting those updated Terms. We recommend that you save or print a copy of these Terms.</p>
                <p><strong>Section 14 of these Terms contains an arbitration agreement and class action waiver that apply to all claims brought against Dubaitrip in the United States. Please read them carefully.</strong></p>
                <p>In these Terms:</p>
                <p>“<strong>we</strong>", “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>” refer to Dubaitrip, Inc., a Washington corporation, having its registered office at 1111 Dubaitrip Group Way, West Seattle, WA 98119, USA, which provides our Service</p>

                <p><strong>Section 1 Rules and Restrictions
                </strong></p>
                <p>As well as these Terms, other terms and conditions provided by Travel Providers (such as an airline’s conditions of carriage, or a property’s terms and conditions, or a car rental company’s rental agreement, etc.) also apply to your booking (“<strong>Rules and Restrictions</strong>”).</p>
                <p>To make a booking, you must accept the Rules and Restrictions of the Travel Provider that you select (such as payment of due amounts, refundability, penalties, availability restrictions and use of fares or services, etc.). The relevant Rules and Restrictions are provided to you before you make a booking and are incorporated by reference into these Terms.</p>
                <p>If you violate a Travel Provider's Rules and Restrictions, your booking may be cancelled and you may be denied access to the relevant Travel Service. You may also lose any money paid for such booking and we or the Travel Provider may debit your account for any costs we or they incur as a result of such violation.</p>

                <p>How we order your search results</p>
                <p>There are many travel options available through our Service and we want to make your search results as relevant as possible. At the search results page you can select how to sort your results and use filter options to prioritise results based on your chosen preferences, for example price, guest review score, or other criteria. If you decide not to use these features, then you will see our default sort order which orders results as set out here.</p>
                <p>Within your search results we also sometimes display travel options that are paid-for commercial listings from our Travel Providers. Such travel options are clearly labelled for your information as “Ad” or similar equivalent labelling, to differentiate them from other travel options.</p>
                <p>Redirection and third-party booking services</p>
                <p>If you are redirected from our Service to a third-party booking service to make a travel booking, please bear in mind that any bookings made through such a booking service will be with the third-party and not with us. We are not responsible for bookings made through third-party booking services and we have no liability to you in respect of such a booking. The terms and conditions of the third-party service provider will set out what rights you have against them and will explain their liability to you.</p>
                <p><strong>Section 3 Confirming a booking</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Your Booking Confirmation includes the essential elements of your booking, such as the description of the Travel Service(s) booked and the price.</p>
                <p>We will send your Booking Confirmation and any relevant travel documents to the email address you provide when you book. If you do not receive your Booking Confirmation within 24 hours of making your booking, please contact us.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Section 4 Payment</strong></p>
                <p>Price</p>
                <p>The price of the Travel Service(s) will be as displayed on our Service, except in cases of obvious error.</p>
                <p>Prices for Travel Services are dynamic and can change at any time. Price changes will not affect bookings already accepted, except in cases of obvious error. We display many Travel Services, and we try hard to ensure that the displayed price is accurate. We reserve the right to correct any pricing errors on our Service.</p>
                <p>If there is an obvious error and you have made a booking, we will offer you the opportunity to keep your booking by paying the correct price or we will cancel your booking without penalty. We have no obligation to make available Travel Services to you at an incorrect (lower) price even after you have been sent a Booking Confirmation, if the error should reasonably have been apparent to you.</p>
                <p>Taxes</p>
                <p>The prices displayed through our Service may include taxes or tax recovery charges. Such taxes or tax recovery charges may include amounts associated with value-added tax, goods and services tax, sales tax, occupancy tax and other taxes of a similar nature.</p>
                <p>You acknowledge that except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amounts received from you, including facilitation fees and service fees where applicable in accordance with Section 6 (Stays) below, our Group of Companies does not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on Pay Now bookings are a recovery of the estimated taxes that our Group of Companies pay to the Travel Provider for taxes due on the services provided by the Travel Provider (such as for the rental rate for the room). The Travel Providers are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by jurisdiction. The actual amounts paid by our Group of Companies to the Travel Providers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the services provided by the Travel Provider.</p>
                <p>Sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes are imposed on the amounts that our Group of Companies charge for services they provide (service fee and/or facilitation fee) in certain jurisdictions. The actual amount imposed on services provided by our Group of Companies may vary depending on the rates in effect at the time the services are provided by the Travel Provider. In certain jurisdictions, our Group of Companies are responsible for collecting and remitting sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes for the entire price, including the amounts we charge for our services as well as the Travel Services provided by the Travel Provider.</p>
                <p>In certain jurisdictions, you may be responsible for paying local taxes imposed by local tax authorities (such as city taxes or tourist taxes, etc.). Our Group of Companies or the Travel Provider may charge you such local taxes. Our Group of Companies will notify you of any local taxes that will be payable by you before you complete your booking, where such taxes have been notified to our Group of Companies by the Travel Provider.</p>
                <p>The amount of local taxes can change between the booking date and stay date. If taxes have changed by your stay date, you may be liable to pay taxes at the higher rate.</p>
                <p>Payment processing
                </p>
                <p>For certain Travel Services, such as a Package (as defined in Section 6 (Packages), payment may be charged by more than one party (as will be shown on your payment method statement), however the total amount charged will not exceed the total price of all the Travel Services.</p>
                <p>When payment is taken at the time of your booking and paid for in the local currency of our Service (as relevant), the company taking that payment (via third-party payment processors) and charging your payment method will be the company set out next to the relevant location of our Service in the table below.</p>
