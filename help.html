                        <div class="helpText">
                            <p>There are many travel options available on our sites and we want to make your search results as relevant as possible. That’s why we offer lots of ways to help you search for and plan your travel.</p>
                            <p>Our site uses complex, dynamic algorithms to ensure your search results are ordered efficiently.</p>
                            <p>On the search results page, you can select how to sort the results we display, and also use filter options to see only those search results that meet your chosen preferences. If you don’t decide to use these features, then you’ll see our chosen default sort order which orders results as follows:</p>
                            <p><strong>for Flights</strong></p>
                            <p>Results are ordered lowest to highest price. Where two flights have the same price, the shorter flight is listed first.</p>
                            <p><strong>for Accommodation</strong></p>
                            <p>Results are ordered starting with the most relevant and competitive offers based on a range of factors, including a property’s offered price compared to its historical prices, its guest rating, number of reviews, number of bookings to date, and location (relative to your destination search).</p>
                            <p>They are also further differentiated by traveller satisfaction factors, including the range and quality of images and information provided for properties, the number of guest relocations and the number of refunds due to complaints about stays, property availability on our sites, and the overall price competitiveness for our travellers.</p>
                            <p>In addition, how much we are paid (eg: commissions from accommodation or compensation on bookings) when you book a property and such booking is completed is one of the factors taken into consideration when determining the relative order of properties with similar offers in our search results listings. What we are paid recognises the part we play in listing the property on our site, facilitating the booking and facilitating your stay at the property. Where we are displaying properties with a similar offer, then a booking from which we are paid more commission or compensation will feature higher in our search results listing compared to other properties with similar offers where we are paid less commission or compensation on the booking.</p>
                            <p><strong>for Cars</strong></p>
                            <p>Results are ordered by taking into account price and other factors such as the number of bookings of an offer to date, customer review scores, car category/type and pick-up location relative to your arrival location.</p>
                            <p><strong>for Cruises</strong></p>
                            <p>Results are ordered by taking into account factors such as cruise line rating, ship rating, price per day, origin rating, destination rating, length of cruise and booking window.</p>
                            <p><strong>for Things to Do</strong></p>
                            <p>Results are ordered by taking into account factors such as price, searched-for experiences, location including distance from accommodation options, traveller reviews and local research. In addition, they may also take into account number of bookings to date and compensation we may earn on a booking.</p>
                            <p><strong>for Combined Searches and Vacation Packages</strong></p>
                            <p>Results are ordered by the criteria outlined above for each individual component.</p>
                            <p>If you select a specific sort order option such as those prioritising price, deals, guest reviews, property class or rating, distance from centre, etc., the results list will be ordered with a focus on your selected priorities, using the factors described above as they relate to your search. This will also be the case for some pages that showcase offers in a destination or for a style of accommodation, etc.</p>
                            <p>If you apply a filter, the results list will be presented using the factors described above as they relate to your search, filtered by the specific feature(s) and amenity(ies) you’ve selected.</p>
                            <p>We’re constantly updating our systems and testing new ways to refine your results to make them as relevant as possible to accommodate your needs.</p>

                            <p>When you browse our European Union (EU) websites and book a property that’s located in the EU/European Economic Area (EEA), it may be provided by a professional host (this is generally the case) or it may be provided by a private host.</p>
                            <p>If you have a professional host, that means it’s their job to offer properties for booking — it’s part of their trade, business, or profession.</p>
                            <p>If the property has told us they are a ‘private host,’ that means they’re offering a property for booking, but it’s not something they do as a trade, business, or profession. These kinds of properties are not subject to the same EU consumer protection rules that apply to professional hosts.</p>
                            <p>‘Private host’ properties are marked with a badge on their description page. Unbadged properties are provided by a professional host.</p>

                        <div class="helpText">
                            <p>Have you received an automated phone call claiming that you’ve won a prize from a well-known travel company? This is a scam. Hang up and do not give the caller any information.</p>
                        <p><strong>What it is</strong></p>
                        <p>The scammers typically use “spoofing” technology to make the incoming telephone number falsely appear to originate from a local area code.</p>
                        <p>Calls usually begin with a pre-recorded message claiming the caller is a well-known travel company, and promising the recipient has “won” some type of prize or discount off travel services. These prizes, which are also fake, can range from cash cards, trips, or credit for future travel.</p>
                        <p>The phone calls can be quite convincing, since the callers take steps to hide their identity and pretend to represent established businesses or organizations. However, the information you provide (such as name and address, payment information, or a social security number) goes directly to the criminal, who can then use the information to his or her own advantage.</p>
                        <p><strong>What you can do</strong></p>
                        <p>We will never call or send an email asking for your password or other personal information. If you think you have received a fraudulent phone call:</p>
                        <p>Hang up. Do not engage with the caller. Take note of the number displayed (if available) and any other identifying information the caller provided.</p>
                        <p>Report the scam to the authorities. Whether about this scam or others, your report can help identify patterns of fraud and abuse.</p>

                            <p>Due to COVID-19, most refunds for flights are issued within 12 weeks. Some refunds could take a bit longer, depending on the airline.</p>
                        <p>Refunds for hotel, car, or activity are processed within our normal timeframe, 24 hours from the cancellation request. Keep in mind, your bank or payment service determines when the funds become available in your account.</p>
                        <p>In other circumstances not impacted by COVID-19, here’s what you should know about refund timelines:</p>
                        <p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
                        <p>Some bookings are non-refundable. For these bookings, you will not receive a refund if you change or cancel.</p>
                        <p>Some bookings are refundable. For these bookings, you may be eligible for either a partial or full refund if you change or cancel.</p>
                        <p>If your booking is eligible for a refund, we usually process the refund within 24 hours.</p>
                        <p>After we process your refund, it may take up to 7 days for your financial institution to post the credit to your account, and up to 2 billing cycles for that credit to show on your statement.</p>
                        <p>Once we initiate your refund, we will email you a refund receipt with details regarding the refund amount, how, and when you'll get your refund.</p>
                        <p>In general, you will be refunded in the same form of payment and currency you used when booking.</p>
                        <p>Please check the rules and restrictions in your itinerary for refund details prior to initiating a change or cancellation.</p>

                            <p>If your payment was declined, it may be due to one of the following reasons. Here’s a list of the most common reasons, and what you can do to troubleshoot the issue:</p>
                        <p><strong>Reason:</strong>You exceeded your card limit.</p>
                        <p><strong>What to do:</strong>Confirm the card has enough funds available (either check your account balance or contact your card issuer), or try another card.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reason:</strong>You have a typo in the payment details, such as incorrect billing address or card expiration date.</p>
                        <p><strong>What to do:</strong>Verify you entered accurate information.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reason:</strong>You entered an unsupported payment method.</p>
                        <p><strong>What to do:</strong>Check on the payment page whether your payment method is accepted.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reason:</strong>Your card issuer couldn't authorize your transaction due to a technical glitch.</p>
                        <p><strong>What to do:</strong>Contact your card issuer or try again.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reason:</strong>The card issuer noticed a charge that doesn't fit your normal spending pattern and blocked the transaction to protect you.</p>
